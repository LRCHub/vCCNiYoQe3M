m rocket Boy and galaxy girl
zooming around in a space aged world.
We'll travel at the speed of light
so hold on, hold on, hold on tight!

Let's fly, lets fly to the stars
Let's fly, lets fly to Jupiter and Mars!

We'll go round and round the universe
Boom! We're caught in a starburst
spinning round and round and round the galaxy.

We'll orbit the moon and shoot for the stars
follow a comet and travel afar.
Jump in our space suits and tumble and play
zipping around the milky way.

Let's fly, lets fly to the stars
Let's fly, lets fly to Jupiter and Mars!

We'll go round and round the universe
Boom! We're caught in a starburst
spinning round and round and round the galaxy.

Round and round we go (Round and round we go)
Round and round we go (Round and round we go)
Round and round the universe
the set the course for home!

We'll go round and round the universe
Boom! We're caught in a starburst
spinning round and round and round the galaxy.

We'll go round and round the universe
Boom! We're caught in a starburst
spinning round and round and round the galaxy.
spinning round and round and round the galaxy.
